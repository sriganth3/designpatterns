# Design Patterns
## What's a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Type of Design Pattern
1. Creational patterns
	-> Factory
	-> Abstract Factory
	-> Builder
	-> Prototype
	-> Singleton
2. Structural patterns
3. Behavioral patterns

## Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
## Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
## Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
